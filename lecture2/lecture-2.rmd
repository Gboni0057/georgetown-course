Data manipulation can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people.  Here, we are mainly working with rectangular data, where a rows represent dataset entries and columns represent attributes of the entries.  

The most powerful functions for data manipulation are `sort`, `reshape`, `collapse`, and `merge`.  With these functions, you can quickly assemble nearly all 

```{r comment=NA, cache=TRUE}
(X <- data.frame(id=c(1,1,2,2), t=c(1,2,1,2), x1=c(5,3,6,2), x2=c(6,5,1,4)))
```
